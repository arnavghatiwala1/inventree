# InvenTree
### The InvenTree App

This repository contains the code for an iOS app I created - InvenTree. To put it briefly, Inventree is about everything trees, 
allowing users to view the trees and empty planting spots around them in an interactive map view, add new trees through verification,
host tree plantation drives, and simply learn more about their local environment!

### Technical Specifications

This app is built using Swift, integrating the Firebase and Google Maps APIs.

### Availability

To use this app, you can search InvenTree on the App Store or simply go to https://apps.apple.com/in/app/inventree/id1511303956.
